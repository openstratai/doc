# What is the Task System of Openstrat

Openstrat is an AI software focused on the U.S. stock market, and its task system is a special module separated from regular AI chat, designed to execute specific types of tasks.

## Core Features

Unlike regular AI dialogues, the task system follows relatively fixed trigger rules and response generation, ensuring it can operate stably over the long term.

Users can create tasks to utilize this functionality—similar to launching an app on a mobile phone. When not needed, the task can be paused or deleted at any time.

## Custom Task Types

The types of tasks that can be created must be customized by developers according to the current version. Since it is built on an AI system, targeted optimization is required to prevent random errors caused by the AI.

## Currently Supported Task Types

Supported task types in the current version include:

- **Short-term Technical Bottom** – Focuses on price fluctuations within 7 days
- **Long-term Technical Bottom** – Focuses on price trends over around 30 days

## Supported Stock Symbols

Supported symbols in the current version include:

- **BTC** – Bitcoin
- **U.S. M7 Stocks**
  - AAPL (Apple)
  - MSFT (Microsoft)
  - GOOGL (Google)
  - AMZN (Amazon)
  - TSLA (Tesla)
  - NVDA (NVIDIA)
  - META (Meta)

!> **Note**: Task types and supported symbols may vary by version. Please refer to the latest release notes.
